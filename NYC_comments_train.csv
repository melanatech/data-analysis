1,1962118,"Dr. Goldstein is a very knowledgeable and pleasant doctor. He did not rush me and took the time to get to know a little bit about me on my first visit to him (which is certainly unlike many other doctors who treat you like a part on an assembly line). When I was very sick recently I went to see Dr. Goldstein for the second time, to figure out what was going on. Not only did he properly diagnose me with strep throat and prescribe the right medications, he answered all of my many questions and was just a generally pleasant person. Highly recommend Dr. Goldstein for a Primary Care Physician. He also specializes in gastroentology. Appointments and waiting time are not that bad.",POS

10,1668628,"This is my experience, but I would NOT recommend this doctor's office. Dr. Trakhenberg is obviously knowledgeable, but she did not explain herself during the exam. She was pulling my arm over my head before I realized she was performing a mammogram! It's as simple as telling the patient what you are doing! Also, when I received the results from my papsmear the woman on the phone did not explain anything or address how the diagnosis may be upsetting. She simply said, ""you call back for an exam in 6 months."" I was literally holding back tears on the other end and so I said ""I don't think I want to come back"" she nonchalantly said, ""Well, that's your choice"". And the conversation ended. It was a very upsetting experience and I still feel upset weeks later. The front desk staff were disrespectful, which makes me wonder what kind of management they are under that causes them to act this way. This doctor's office needs to make some changes!!

14,1668628,"Overall I liked Dr. Trackhtenberg, although I didn't always appreciate her lack of appreciation for natural childbirth. I also think the hours and demand of her job started to wear her down since she didn't seem to love her job very much. However, I think we gained a good patient/doctor level of respect. What was disapointing is that one day I went to the office and learned she left the practice. I was not previously informed and it was very sudden. Now there is one doctor who has all the patients and probably can't handle the load. I'm wondering if anyone knows what happened to Dr. Trackhtenberg and where she went.",NEU

It made me vomit and fatigued, such that I missed work.  When I called to let him know, he told me these side effects were not consistent with the drug, but to cut in half.  Side effects continued.

My appointment with Dr Cenedese is the most unprofessional & shocking experience I have ever had. I was shocked by his immediate discussion about the dangers of eyelid droop & that there were no guarantees. He barely made eye contact and I felt like he was making excuses for why I was about to get a bad botox result. He was going on so incessantly and negatively that I thought he obviously does not want to give me botox and I should leave. He made only 4 injections in a straight line & never asking me to raise my brow to see the muscle pull. EVERY doctor I have EVER seen has done this. I even asked about it & he said he'd seen my brow raise several times already. I was mortified and my result is AWFUL. The top & bottom of my forehead has wrinkles but none in the very middle.

I can truly say that we both felt that she deeply cared about us and how things would turn out for us and went out of her way to enable us to grow both in our relationship and as individuals.

I had had every possible type of treatment that the other doctors knew of, so I needed a doctor who could do surgery in case that's what was necessary. From my first consultation, he explained what the treatment options were and revealed his suspicion that I would need surgery in the end.  He first tried a splint (bite plate) and then Botox injections, neither of which helped in my case.  I ended up having to have surgery on both sides. I was completely confident having Dr. Black do the surgery. He is the type of doctor who was born to do what he does.

Lastly, one of the receptionists at the front desk was very condescending and rude upon my arrival and when I asked and answered questions. The other two women at the desk were silent as if they did not want to upset the rude one. It seemed the rude woman was in charge. They looked at me sort of helpless and apologetic, being sure not to let the rude one see their reactions as they were standing behind her. Maybe I did not fit the profile of the clients the rude one was accustomed to at this Upper East Side Park Avenue office.

surgery was successful, and now 3 months later,  everything is back to normal including my husband's eye being open and his vision is clear.  Dr. Schwartz was compassionate, considerate, and extremely kind, aside

She told me that I would be billed for an office visit and incur a co-pay, which is exactly what I wanted to hear. I paid the co-pay and sat in the waiting room. There was no one else there (a bad sign). Allencherry clipped my toenails. I made small talk. I left.

On 11/12/14, 4 months later, I received a bill. It stated ""THIS IS YOUR THRID NOTICE."" It wasn't. I had never recd anything from the office. It said I owed a 2nd co-pay. I walked into the office and asked for Diana, who wasn't there. Again, NO ONE WAS WAITING; not a soul there except a receptionist. 

Allencherry came out and attempted to explain the billing to me. I wasn't interested. I told him, ""if you think I'm going to pay $70 (co-pays) to have my nails clipped, you're effing nuts!"" He said -- are you ready? -- I was charged addl money because this was my initial visit. He billed my insurance over $200 for my walking in the door! Can you imagine how many hundreds (OK, tens) of patients -- I can't assume he has very many -- he has overbilled and how many have just paid?

I filed a complaint against him w/the NYS Office of Medical Conduct and posted this review and checked off negative ratings at healthgrades.

Other allergists I have seen since then said that there was no reason for her to do this.

I dont expect to have my hand held, but I do expect to get what I pay for.  This doctor repeatedly disregarded a drug side effect I had.  She sent me to a specialist who immediately told me the side effect was common. When I developed serious side effects with another drug (for a different issue), I had to find another doctor for that too because she again, wrongly, told me they weren't caused by the drug.

She asked me to sign a bunch of forms without telling me what they were and snapped at me when I tried to ask questions.

To give a little background on myself, I am a breast cancer survivor with a gene mutation for ovarian cancer. A I started to explain my fears of getting cancer again, with tears in my eyes, she puts her hands up and says she feels like I'm attacking her, and then she actually had the nerve to ask if she could open the door bc she felt uncomfortable. WHAT!!! I told her that I was the patient and she is the Dr and under no circumstances could she open the door so everyone could hear and see me crying. I felt like I was in a Twilight Zone episode.

She did nothing exam a 2 minute pap exam, then didn't listen to me, then wanted me to book a new appt.
She is not only a self absorbed person who turns everything into something about herself, but she is very strange in her behaviors and should not be a Dr if she gets freaked out by a patient innocently describing their fear of getting cancer again. I have never felt so rejected by a Dr before and then she tries to make me feel like I'm the one with the problem, and that I was attacking or scaring her? Holy Crap!

308,2076989,"Ive had a HORRIBLE experience at Dr. Rachel Villanueva, MD office. I went in for my annual. I waited 45 minutes. Opted to get a full STD screening. THREE people tried to take my blood sample, NONE could get a vein (min you I ate and drank a ton of water before my appointment). One of the woman who tried to take my blood stuck into my arm and literally started to swivel it in my arm as a haphazard way to find my vein. Once all the assistants failed to access a vein (please note that I am an physically active 27 year old biracial woman and I have no medical issues) ,the office then choose to fill out a script for the STD screening to  Quest lab (the specific form I had received was for was quest lab and I was advised to make to make an appointment online) . I go to Quest lab and this lab  DOES NOT take my insurance. I called the office and asked them how did this happen. The office then tells me that Quest lab should have notified me of the insurance issue. REALLY!!!! This office sent me the INCORRECT script, then proceeds to put the blame elsewhere. The office then informed me that I would have to call on Monday to recieve the correct paperwork. Incompetency level (on a scale of 1-10) is a 10, Customer service ( on a level of 1-10) is a 0. DO NOT BOOK AN APPOINTMENT HERE.",NEG
309,2076989,"If I can give her 0 stars I would! I was under Dr. Villanueva's care in 2014 and unfortunately she delivered my baby. I was hoping for Dr. Jaffe. From start to finish she was very rude. When checking my cervix she was way too rough, and told me ""delivering the baby wont be gentle"". Hello it was my first and thanks to her maybe my last pregnancy! I had frequent and PAINFUL uti's and not ONCE did she ever call me to check up on me. Not to mention it took 2 days before she prescribed antibiotics for me. I had to call the office ever hour or two and never got the phone call. I was told she went on her lunch break KNOWING how much pain I was in (mind you I was 8.5 months pregnant already).  Really, your lunch break couldn't wait 2 minutes? They already had my pharmacy information, and I had to call back to let them know I was leaving work early to please send to the pharmacy at my home (gave the info) and it gets sent to the pharmacy by my job! WTF good is that!? Thankfully, I too work for a physician and got the antibiotics I needed. 

I felt so judged everytime I went to that office. She constantly brought up my weight, and how unhappy she was with it. Losing weight just isn't that simple when you're pregnant, especially when you were never huge to begin with and suddenly blow up. My knee's and joints always hurt, I worked 45 hour work weeks, give me a break! I also had hyperthyroid, I was looking at her to explain further, and she gets upset and tells me ""If I have a question, ask"" all snobby. TF is your problem!? I'm the pregnant one here! 

I was two weeks late and had to be induced. I was happy because I was under Dr. Jaffe's care then Ursula came and took over the shift. This Dr. is seriously not friendly or gentle. And I have a high pain tolerance but she was just too much for anyone's first delivery. I had to be dilated with a balloon and she yanked it out of me (that wasn't too bad), when it was time to break my water with that hook instrument( which I was never informed that she was going to break it, everyone must of known BUT ME) it was like she was trying to forcefully take out my whole damn uterus. The nurses and my spouse had to hold me down because the pain was so unbearable. Her being rough was worse then the actual pushing and contractions! 

LET ME NOT FORGET TO MENTION: This woman had on rings on like 3 of her fingers when checking my cervix. Whats that about>?

Finally after almost 4 hours of pushing (almost got forced into a C-section) my daughters head came out! and ofcourse I stopped pushing at that moment because I was excited to feel her head. What does she do? finishes pulling out my baby without me pushing and I tore from the top to my bottom, and needed stitches!!!!! I was so distracted that I didn't feel too much of the tear but it burned like hell. 

How that night ended? well she gave me the ""see you in 6 weeks"" and tells another nurse she's going to go watch Scandal. -___- She never followed up to see how I was doing, never gave an explanation on why I never heard from her when I called her office several times crying because I was in so much pain from the UTI (pain radiated to my back, I couldn't even walk)....and you know what I didn't bother going to her office ever again. 

She may know what she is doing but she's lacking. You shouldn't treat your patients this way. It wasn't a good experience at all.",NEG
310,2076989,"I delivered my baby at NYU in July after approximately 42 hours of labor. The delivering doctor was Dr. Jaffee of Rosh Maternal Medicine, who was absolutely incredible, supportive, nurturing, and easy going. Prior to working with Dr. Jaffee, however, I was under the care of Dr. Rachel Villanueva, also from the same practice as Dr. Jaffee (Rosh Maternal Medicine).

My contractions began at approximately 2:00 a.m., I checked into NYU that eve at 10:00 pm, and had an epidural. The next morning, despite starting Pitocin, I wasn't really dilated. 2 hours into the course, Dr. Rachel Villanueva came into my room and was very emphatic that it was ""time for me to have the baby"", and that she was going to break my water immediately as it had not broken yet. I was unsure about taking this step, but Dr. Rachel Villanueva was insistent that it was the ""best and safest course of action for the baby"" to take at that time.

This was my first pregnancy and given that I had tested GBS positive I knew a little bit about the concerns for infection if my water was broken ""too early."" Further, I was overly fatigued from not having slept in over 24 hours, and, perhaps more importantly, I was just plain scared of what was coming. When I shared these concerns with Dr. Rachel Villanueva and explained that I was a little hesitant to break my water so soon, she became terse with me and told me that I had chosen her practice to monitor my pregnancy and delivery of our baby, and therefore I ought to have trust in her decisions and not question them. She also told me that if she were ever to seek my counsel on a matter in which I was a specialist, she, too, would trust whatever I would say and not question my knowledge or expertise. I explained, while in tears, that I was scared, and that I was beginning to feel pressured by her tone and approach, and that I wanted time to think it over with my husband and doula (both of whom were present during Dr. Rachel Villanueva's lecture) just to make sure I understood what the procedure would entail and how it would affect my labor. Looking back, I really think I was just scared about moving into the next phase of labor, since, despite the epidural, I was actually in a lot of pain and discomfort. But I asked Dr. Rachel Villanueva to come back in ten minutes so I could just think it over. She said ""ok"" and stalked out of the room. 

The nurse who was treating me saw me crying and explained to me that Dr. Rachel Villanueva was simply an efficient practitioner who treated everyone ""that way"" and that I shouldn't read into her tone or be affected by her approach. And while that may be true, I was in my most vulnerable state and was feeling confused and uncertain as to how to proceed, and felt unable to get comfort or even sufficient information from Dr. Rachel Villanueva due to her approach. 

After an hour passed and Dr. Rachel Villanueva failed to return, my husband went to look for her. He found her in the hallway and asked to speak with her, explaining that I was ready to have my water broken given that she felt it was the best thing to do from a medical perspective. He asked her whether she could come back into the room to affirm that was in fact her medical opinion, but Dr. Rachel Villanueva declined to do this. She said that she did not like being told that she was pressuring a patient, and would be back later because she had other things to do. My husband told her that we simply wanted to make sure that steps were being taken for the best and safest outcome for both myself and my baby, and that she had recommended this course of action over an hour ago so we didn't want to incur any unnecessary risk because of delay.

Another hour or so passed, and Dr. Rachel Villanueva appeared with an entourage of nurses. She quickly broke my water and said she'd be back within 2 hours to check my dilation. She made no mention of the conversation with my husband, nor did she ask me how I was feeling or make any effort whatsoever to check in with me and ensure my comfort. After she left another doctor took over. I complained to the board at NYU and they assured me that she had been informed of my concerns and that my point was taken seriously.

311,2076989,"Absolutely horrible.  I can't believe I've been seeing her for so many years...I guess I just put up with her bad attitude becuase I only dealt with her for 30 minutes once a year.  Yesterday, however, she gave me a paragard (copper iud) and it was the most horrendous medical experience I've ever endured.  She entered my room with a chip on her shoulder - essentially she was pissed off that I scheduled the appointment without first having a consultation about it.  When I reminded her that we discussed it last year, she was like ""...that was a year ago!"" What difference does it make?? The risks haven't changed in a year! She is clearly against women receiving paragards without having a baby first, but I am fully aware of the risks and benefits and I am ultimately in control of what form of birth control I need/want.  As stated, she's been my gyn for years and SHOULD be aware of the clotting issues in my family, yet she proceeded to enter my room with disgust and asked ""...so why can't you have hormones?"" I was so annoyed.  I really think she's bipolar, because after the insertion and confirmatory ultrasound she seemed happy and bubbly.  I then had to finish with a quick chat in her office where she still seemed to be on the ""happy"" side, but that faded quickly when I asked for a prescription - she returned to her usual uninterested, annoyed, and condescending bedside manner.  I'm thrilled that she was able to insert my iud, but will NEVER step foot in her office again. Actually, she changed practices a few years ago and refuses to disclose any details - I'm sure they fired her due to bad reviews. She's the worst and I'm *finally* in search of an approachable gynecologist. Her bad attitude may in fact be the reason she's single with no babies........",NEG

When asked about different forms on birth control, she mentioned they ""don't do that here, and that i should try planned parent hood"".

She doesn't encourage questioning, she isn't empathetic, and her and the office has NO SENSE OF URGENCY.  

It took them over 24 hours to verify they received the sonogram and over 36 hours to confirm that I was in fact having a miscarriage. I had to actually do most of the work myself. Called her office about 10 times, asked my husband to call and put some pressure on her staff, I emailed them through the portal which only seems to be managed by the Dr. herself... it was ridiculous.  

When I asked her questions about X,Y,Z, via email NOT A PHONE CALL, she says""I told you about this at your visit."" I was an emotionally drained woman having a miscarriage, my apologies for not understanding your quick explanations about X, Y, and Z.  She's rude and insensitive. 

Long story short, I quickly had my sonograms from the Radiologist faxed to a new OBGYN, wouldn't count on her office to get anything right regarding medical records, and quickly learned from the new Dr. what was relevant to my situation.

As I left the office, one of the other patients approached me and said Dr. Rosenberg gave her a prescription that was irrelevant to her condition. They lost all her records and they prescribed her something for an issue she had in 2010. She also said she underwent a procedure that was NOT supposed to happen. I assume they mixed up records and thought she needed it. The office does not keep track of why patients are coming in. I had an urgent issue to discuss with Dr. Rosenberg, which I explained when making the appointment, but they had no idea when I got there.

1. For many orthodontist places, the specialized doctors work on your teeth. Here, they hire inexperienced people who ""PRACTICE"" on your teeth and learn from their mistakes on YOUR teeth.

2. In addition, many orthodontists take the time to explain to you what they will do on your teeth and why. HERE, they do not give you a chance to speak or ask questions. Whenever you want to ask something, they tell you to open your mouth, and I'm like DUDE HOW CAN I SPEAK IF YOU GOT YOUR HANDS IN MY MOUTH. 
 
3. The staffs appear to be nice at first so you will want to pay them to have your braces done here, but after you pay them, THAT'S IT. THEY BECOME SO RUDE. THEY GO FROM 0 TO 100 REAL QUICK. 

4. Dr. Lai, the actual doctor is barely there. He doesn't care about you. All he sees are dollar signs. He is A BIG BABY, super immature. I was talking to him on the phone in a well-mannered way and you know what he said to me? ""I DONT WANT TO TALK TO YOU"" and hung up. He ACTUALLY hung up on me.

5. Once you are a patient there. You are chained there. FOREVER. After your braces are off, every time you go there, it is $75 per check up just to look at your teeth. In many other places, it is FREE.

I was paying over $250 per visit, so I expect to have an ACTUAL certified doctor, not some damn intern, meanwhile Dr Yon Lai is chilling inside his office, outside doing whatever or bragging about how many clients/profit he makes to his investors. If you're on medicaid/care he will slowly drag out how long you need your braces for so he can cheat the government.

Yes I'm asian and thought it would be a good idea to go to the doctor closest to where I live, but after a few visits I quickly regretted it, so I changed and went somewhere else. Most of the people that goes to Dr Yon Lai are FOBs(fresh off boat or just uneducated) or have parents that are FOBs so that don't know any better. I had to wait for 30 mins and when it was my turn, they just looked at my braces and told me I can go, which took less than 3 minutes and charged me $250.

I did a lot of research and I found Dr. Levine. I was looking for someone to do upper and lower eye lid surgery and it was important to me that they only did facial surgery. I liked Dr. Levine immediately. She was honest, very easy to talk to, and I liked that she believed in only doing what looked natural. She is also an ENT, is double board certified and has great credentials. I felt very comfortable and I knew I could trust her. Her staff was also very friendly and helpful. 

My surgery was last January and I am beyond thrilled. The procedure and the healing was much easier than I had thought it would be and there was absolutely NO pain...which totally surprised me! Dr. Levine had me come to her office fairly regularly to make sure that I was healing properly and to address any concerns I might have.

The outcome is even better than I expected! I am in the performing arts and I see a lot of people through my work. I only told my close friends that I was doing the surgery.

He is fre-king cocking and arrogant.  If you know English very well, he might be not as cocky since it might seem like you are highly educated. But if your language is just chinese, he will be cocky because I suspect he thinks you aren't educated.  This is based on personal experience and observation of how he treats others.   Besides him, in the office, there seems to be a completely outdated, incompetent and messed up billing system which seems to mess up patients billing record.  Almost EVERYONE who had gone into this firm had billing problems stating they have to pay more than needed.  I know my insurance inside and out but yet their computer system always say I have to pay when I KNOW it is 100% covered.  I did an investigation and realized James or someone had entered in wrong billing information and that is why there this billing issue kept showing up in the computer system.  I do not know if it was intended in hope that most patients are uneducated or didn't want to bother to find out or their office system is just messed up and incompetent.  THIS alone should prevent you from going there as pregnancy is already a bit of a stress as it is. Don't need this unnecessary stressful event to be added on.

Front office nurse that takes care of patients measurements - rating 3 out of 5 stars
Nurses seems very nice, but the turn over rate is a bit high.  During 9 months, I have already seen different faces like over 10.. I suspect those ladies can't stand the cocky James..whom I heard speaking in a way that it sounds like it's his way or the high way.

Dr Yeh Ping Chou: rating  2 out of 5 stars.
Basically if you have simple normal pregnancy, she is fine. If you have any complications, wow.. it might be better off to find another one.  At times, when I asked her a 'technical' question regarding some laboratory test,  she CANNOT answer it..and doesn't know what they are.  In fact, she was surprised at the details which I paid attention to and also was surprise to see the report I was reading as either she forgot that the report was there or maybe that it was just some detail which should not really matter since it says the baby was normal anyways.  But she finally gave me the answer after she went outside and I think called the lab what the definition is.   Being an ob, you should know what that is as I also found the answer on the web..but it's a research papers so I have to read it carefully.  I also asked a MD in the hospital who specializes in fetal development /ob/gyn and she was ABLE to immediately let me know what the terminology really meant as that test was some newer test beside the normal fish test.  Anyways, the baby was normal and fine.   Also sometimes she takes on too much patient that she doesn't have time to sleep and gets grudgy.  So scare that she doesn't have enough sleep when she delivered the baby.. but luckily she did and it was fine.  

Conclusion is that, If they change the front office and more competent billing system,  It might be fine, else if they still have that incompetent billing system and that attitude, find another one.   But if you are old and afraid of having some complications, find another doctor.",NEG

You made me feel very comfortable, you explained everything in great detail and most of all you put together a treatment plan with the care and concern as though I was part of your family. You are a wonderful doctor and most of all a wonderful person that truly cares about others and you seem to love what you do. My sincere thanks to you. 
You are Incredible.

In addition, she is very knowledgeable, not only about the traditional methods of treating prostate cancer, but also about more natural, less invasive alternatives.  During my first visit, she presented and explained a treasure chest of good suggestions and options. In addition, she is so well-connected to other specialists in the New York area, and so ready to consult with, and refer to those related specialists, that seeing Dr. Cheetham was like seeing an entire team of doctors!  But what I appreciated the most about Dr. Cheetham was her willingness to listen to, and respect my own ideas, and preferences.  I have seen over a dozen first-class New York City doctors in the past few years for their opinions about my prostate cancer.

745,825246,Dr. Cheetham is an amazing doctor!  I was referred to Dr. Cheetham in June 2014 for testicular cancer.  I was a nervous wreck up until I met her.  Dr. Cheetham walked into the examining room like my wife and I had known her for years.  She met with us and literally drew out the procedure that I was going to have.  We had so many questions and she just sat with us for what seemed like hours.  Her caring nature immediately put me at ease.  I literally left her office and was like “I’m going to be ok”.  Post-surgery I had a ton of questions and she was always available to answer my questions and put me at ease.  Her knowledge is just amazing.  I have seen Dr. Cheetham several times since my surgery and I have to say that I am truly blessed to have her in my corner.  I could not recommend a better doctor.,POS

I feel incredibly fortunate to have met her and trust her judgment immensely. I’ve also learned a great deal from her clinically, particularly from her Sunday radio show/podcasts on WABC.  She’s innovative and a master in her field. I would highly recommend Dr. Cheetham!",POS

Dr. C. not only took a very detailed medical history but demonstrated to me something I had not experienced before.Dr C's attention to even small specific details made me feel very comfortable.She performed or ordered diagnostic tests immediately in order to determine the proper treatment for me. Her dedication, patience and proficient manner are a rare combination. Upon reviewing the data Dr. C. recommended a procedure that had not been proposed to me before. It was quickly scheduled and I am improving every day. An ordinary thank you is inadequate as Dr. C. has given me back my quality of life.Seeing Dr.Cheetham was the best decision I have made.",POS

At that point, it became my opinion that she orders fancy tests, but doesn't seem to know how to read the results.  Like others who posted, I experience that she doesn't call with results.   She told my my vitamins were deficient.  I also got another opinion on that and I was told they were fine.  She asked me to mega doses of vitamin, which from what I read it sounds like are an unabsorably high amount.  I also agree with others who said she seems to be in a hurry.

It's always tons of blood work for no reason and they even charge you to make a paper copy!!!( how cheap is that? I mean seriously? ). The staff on the phone is rude and so is she.

In the past two years I had been to two different endocrinologists, who were unable to properly diagnose my thyroid condition. I had extreme difficulty losing weight, I was depressed and fatigued.  They both told me that my thyroid levels are OK, and my enlarged thyroid with multiple nodules and cysts is ""normal"".  According to them I was completely healthy, and my overweight was the result of eating too much.

Dr.G will not talk on the phone about test results even though they may be no issues. If you do get her on the phone, she is extremely hurried, rude and always ends with 'I have other patients.'

There is always a chance of ""something"". Dr. Cheon tends to overcall any small indication of problem and make you nervous by getting panic herself.

I am single and currently not in a relationship and desire not to raise children alone.  I should not have to be reminded of my status from my obgyn that I am getting older and should have kids when I really dont have a lot of control over whether I will meet someone who is suitable to bear children with in my late 30s.

They were a good tag team and made sure someone was always going to follow up with you.  Also, Dr. Cheon has a ~90% patient delivery rate. Many other doctors rotate their ""on call"" times at hospitals so you might see one doctor most of your pregnancy only to have her/his colleague deliver your baby!

Some of her advice is hurtful and not very insightful and dispensed without regard to patient feelings. Not a very comforting dr. Seems to know her pharmacology best and can select Rx's well.

Did lab work on me once & almost put me on a med I didn't need because she misinterpreted a lab report. Tried 2 scare me of med I was taking by telling me it would give me a stroke or heart attack. (No scientific evidence 2 support this, I checked.) Her 1 advantage is that she knows how ins. works & knows how 2 get around it. So she'd write me Rxs 4 double the meds I needed so I'd get more meds w/the same co-pay.

When she called me with my results I was reprimanded for calling the office after hours, when she only called me 2 minutes prior and I missed her call.  When I returned her call, she basically told me to only call during office hours. We scheduled a follow up. And again she called me after hours to tell me about the results and left a message.

Dr. Spiera became my doctor for the next 9 years because he had the courage to respectfully disagree with his colleague, telling me that I didn't have enough symptoms to be diagnosed with lupus. He was absolutely wonderful and if it weren't for his unending support and his mantra (""You are a healthy young woman with some symptoms of lupus and you have to see yourself as a healthy young woman""), I would have succumbed to an illness that I didn't have and limited myself unnecessarily. Was his secretary friendly to me at first? No. After a couple of years of visits, though, she warmed up.

While the previous rater has an interesting, and possibly accurate, take on the secreatary situation, as the individual in question  acts with the dr.'s blessing if not by his bidding, the dr. is also a gifted physician  who treats his patients with compassion, which I grant you, begs the question as to why the secretary is allowed to act as a tyrant. Never the less, when one suffers from a painful rheumatalogic illness, a doctor like Dr. Speira can be few and far between.

Fortunately for him he has a lot of gullible patients that believe he is a good doctor so it is worthwhile to put up with this abuse from his long time secretary.  However, it is incompatible for a good doctor to let a cruel assistant do his bidding.  A doctor like any other professional must not only be technically proficient, but must abide by the ethics of his profession to be considered commendable.

During my 6 week post-partum visit, he performed a pelvic exam on me which was very painful. He didn't warn me or give me a chance to relax before he inserted the speculum and examined me manually.

She performed the procedures painlessly and with outstanding results. This included an extraction which was very difficult because of a root that was ""hooked"" and placement of an implant with minimal available space.

I was not surprised at all to see even the worst negative comments regarding his mannerisms, for I have lived through all of the most uncomfortable and socially inappropriate things he does. He does comment about women’s appearance, he does dress unusually; he does castigate defiance. I’m not here to say that this does not exist. However, all of that has nothing to do with a patient’s medical care. A patient goes to see a doctor for medical treatment; respectful treatment is subject to the individual’s beliefs and cannot satisfy all. Dr. Barandes may come across as an insensitive old man to some, but what I can say from experience is that he acts the way he does because he believes it’s polite. We may not all agree with his manors, but if a patient does have an issue with how he acts, just politely tell him it makes you uncomfortable.

Of course 3 weeks later my thyroid wend into complete failure and I had to be treated right away. Good thing I found a new endo who actually CARES about their patients.

She is very efficient & helps you out when she can.  As for all the negative comments others have written, I cannot disagree more.

One is that sometimes you can be in and out in 15 minutes, and other times I was in the office for 1.5 h for what ended up being 5 minutes with Dr. Stein.

We did the tests, Dr. Stein removed the cyst (personally, in the OR - he really knows his stuff!), and I got pregnant on the first IUI.  Dr. Stein (or one of the two other MDs he practices with) were at every appointment, including routine monitoring visits; other places use nurses or other assistants for this and I appreciated always having a qualified person to ask questions to.

All the staffers there go out of their way to help—I never felt like a number—and the other two doctors that you see when Dr. Stein isn’t there also show you great care and attention.

Meetings are short but I do feel like my questions were answered. However, I can see why some might feel as a number. Expect to have residents (aka, total strangers) present during transvaginal OB scans, without your prior knowledge or consent.

It was a carcinoid tumor (malignant)--cancer at age 49. I was in shock, and Dr. Kavaler was incredible. He explained everything to me slowly and compassionately and reassured me that everything was going to be ok and that he would set up all the appointments I needed to schedule surgery, get treatment etc. Within moments of finding out my diagnosis, I was walking to the oncologist's office. The tumor was resected, and Dr. Kavaler followed up every step of the way. Since then, whenever I have called with an issue, he has responded immediately.

After the procedure, (two weeks later), He was there to check on me to make sure I was fine and waited until my friend arrived to take me home. A week later I went in for a followup. While I did not have any polyps, he felt there were some other issues going on....perhaps Crohn's. He was sincerely concerned and really took the time to help me understand exactly what the implications of crohn's meant. He was extremely pro-active in getting me an appt with a rheumatologist to help get to the bottom of what the problem could be.

As soon as I woke up, the doctor told me everything was fine in the same sentence that he reminded me to sign the insurance check over to his wife (the anesthesiologist) when it arrives. Poor timing, I would say. He then told me (again--first time was in the consult.) what a wonderful anesthesia this is because it gets patients in and out fast (great for the doctor, I guess). I was dizzy and nauseous and proceeded to throw up in the rest room. No one seemed to be watching or even cared. Very puzzling.

From the moment you walk in they address you by name and before you have time to sit and take samples from the jars on the table they are calling you in.

They listen and are extremely careful when you are feeling sensitive in areas along the gums.  I'm so happy to visit the office and will recommend them to everyone!!,POS
1449,818396,"I had read great reviews of your practice online so I was expecting to have a great experience but I would say you exceeded my expectations. First, almost zero wait-time. Then Dr. Frangella took time talk with me before starting anything and then did some tests that I'd never had before (the 1-2-2-1-3-2-3 test!) and definitely appreciated. He explained everything he was doing as he was doing it and made sure nothing went into my eyes with those goggles. I also think he was super honest in telling me he can't say whether I have a cavity under my crown or not (which my previous dentist had told me was the case). Pretty cool. Then Alexi (sorry if I got her name wrong!) was super awesome and took lots of time to help me understand how best to handle my follow-up appointments to take the most advantage of my insurance, which no dental office or doctor's office has ever done for me. She has saved me lots of money and I'm grateful. And if that weren't enough she even said not to worry about any out-of-pocket from that first appointment. Amazing! Thank you.",POS

The staff was very polite, however they were not always punctual, with wait times up to an hour. I would recommend that if you are struggling with infertility, make sure that you come prepared to your office visits by doing some of your own research in advance so you can ask questions.

I personally had a hard time accepting what he had to say sometimes, or the direction he was going in, because I am stubborn and somehow think I know better than a professional.  But I felt much better after just a few sessions. To me Dr. Anson was not cold but more clinical and pragmatic, which is what I personally wanted. He sympathized with my situation in the first few sessions but then worked with me to identify patterns of thinking from the past to present.

You walk in to a waiting area, and you just wait for your respective doctor to come out and take you into their office. He was punctual. But I have never felt so uncomfortable talking to someone about my issues. His responses, although in a clinical setting very accurate, were given without tact and it seemed like he in no way cared. I saw him for 2 appointments, I was a little skeptical after the first but I figured I may have just been nervous since it was my first time. He said a lot of ""Oh yes, I forgot about that"" and ""Remind me"" in the second appointment.

For example, she was able to advise me on the power of stretching in terms of healing my foot, and urged me to stretch properly when she noticed that I was not doing it correctly; as a direct result, my heel spur is gone. Also, she continually encouraged me to change my bad eating habits although I would not always follow her advise.

What they don't tell you is after paying the regular fees, they will still turn around and file claimed to your insurance leaving you with a big bill.  Effectively you get double charge.

Laakso is ok compared to the many incompetent and abusive psychiatrists I've met. But their hospital methods can be barbaric as if mentally ill people were bad people. Lock up the bad people because it is them who cause mental illness without any remorse. Of course, many psychiatrists are bad. Is Dr. Laakso bad ? Her opinions can be bad. How come ?

Both other doctor treatments ended in disaster(I was close to hospitalisaton)!  I 'RAN BACK TO' Dr. Laakso! to fix me!

Once she handed me a flyer telling ""bipolar"" people (and remember, you are bipolar to her) they must be in bed by 10 and up at 6 a.m. or else she ""cannot get you better."" She will tell you that you cannot be in psychodynamic psychotherapy-- ""That is for neurotic people, NOT bipolar (points at you) people. And I will be happy to straighten out any therapist who thinks otherwise."" If you disagree with her, she will tell you, ""You see, you ARE bipolar, or else you wouldn't be this argumentative."" A friend of mine said to me, ""Ha, you should have said to her, 'Then are you bipolar, because you're arguing with me too!"" lol I knew someone who fired her, and in response Dr. Laakso rapidly started pulling out business cards of colleagues who will tell her that they would agree she's bipolar. ""I give conferences, I'm a specialist on bipolar."" When I think back to my experience with her, it's almost HILARIOUS.

After I wised up and left her, and the therapists I saw after her and new psychiatrist told me straight out ""What! You're not bipolar!"" and basically laughed at the bipolar thing, I read in a review she was now telling ""bipolar"" patients to go to bed at 8 and wake up at 3 a.m. LOL Seriously???? She is awful, has been sued for malpractice, and has been given a bad reputation in a very well-known mood disorders support group organization/association in NY. RUN, RUN, RUN, RUN!

After two months, I developed symptoms of Tardive Dyskensia, a neurological movement disorder that is a common side-effect of neuroleptic medications such as Latuda and Abilify--both of which Dr. Laakso is fond of prescribing. The Depakote had robbed the little motivation and energy I usually have, so I stopped taking both immediately.

I'm a 25 year old woman and I started seeing him about 2 years ago for depression and he has always been sarcastic and has given me an attitude.  First of all, He doesn't explain anything about the medicine you are taking and doesn't seem to care about anything but getting you out of his office with a prescription.

 Today I went there because my medicine he prescribed was making me nauseous and I was still feeling very depressed. My sister who is studying psychology and is very concerned about my well being wanted to hear our discussion so she can make sure I am getting the help I need.  I asked if I could call her so she can listen in.  

He got mad and defensive and starting raising his voice that I don't trust him and that he doesn't want her listening to our conversation. This isn't about him its about me. She is concerned about me and she wants to know what's going on.  He said oh you can do that on your own time now here! 

This was my third prescription I have tried and I was still feeling very depressed. He prescribed a new medicine and only told me one side effect so I decided to google it. Then my sister was texting me making sure I ask him questions and he started raising his voice again asking what I was doing and telling me to stop texting her.  Excuse me! I am paying for this session and this is about me getting better not him! I was so startled with the way he was treating me that I got up and left. He said ok give me back the medicine you don't need that.  So he left a depressed person with suicidal thoughts without medicine because he has some sort of ego problem.  He wouldn't give me a prescription either. 

 I left and came back and asked for the medicine because he should provide me with it since I am paying for the session.  He said ""you are very entitled to crazy things"" ""you have a lot of problems"" ""you never like any medicine I give you"" yeah I'm entitled! I'm entitled to get the prescription that I am paying for!  He has one job- literally one job. 

 I told him that he made me feel uncomfortable and he said ""apparently a lot of people make you feel uncomfortable!"" So he was making fun of me.  What kind of doctor does makes fun of their patients and tells them they have problems?! I told him he was most definitely the worst doctor I have ever met and his response ""oh I'm sure you will meet much worse.

When we booked our appointment, we were so excited to see what Dr. Pearlman and his team would suggest. I am so ecstatic about my treatments and results! I received an Ultherapy treatment to tighten and lift the skin on my neck and on my face. I am too young for a facelift, but needed a non-invasive treament, that can be done without any down time, surprisingly comfortable, and quick. Heather is the botox artist!

From the minute of my first encounter with Dr. Pearlman’s staff, to my initial consult with Donna, all thru the Halo procedure, and until I left the office I felt comfortable and at ease in my experience.  After talking with Donna, I knew I was in expert hands. Ms. Fay is very knowledgeable and informative. She listened to my concerns and asked all the right questions to ensure I received the exact, customized treatment I needed to achieve the results I was looking for.
The Halo treatment itself consisted of very minimal pain and discomfort, along with minimal down time.  After the procedure I experience a mild sunburn feeling that subsided after a couple hours. Other than that, I healed in just a week’s time and couldn’t be happier with my results thus far. My dark spots are so much lighter and my skin now has a new youthful glow, thanks to not just the Halo treatment, but to the additional skin products Donna suggested I use to help aid in the healing and restoration of my skin.  I honestly feel in order to achieve the full affect of what the Halo has to offer, using the additional skincare products helps to keep my skin well moisturized, continues to help in the lightening of my dark spots, as well as help maintaining that youthful glow.
Thanks to “The Beauty Expert” and her expertise in customized skincare treatments, I am well on my way to achieving the results of new healthy, youthful look. I am more than excited to see the final results. I have no doubt it will be exactly how I imagine it will be.

At my last appointment, I even called before I left my office to see if they were running on time.  The staff(which I agree is rude and clueless)  told me that she was on time.  When I showed up, I was told that she was at least an hour behind -- and had ""been behind all day""   This after I left work early, took a cab across town, and made it to the office on time for my appointment.

I was nervous  to have surgery, but I knew that my eyelids were really bothering me.  I was constantly having trouble putting eye makeup on and feeling puffy and baggy in the mornings. Dr. Devgan was extremely well qualified, with impeccable credentials.  Her background and training were impressive.  More importantly, though, Dr. Devgan was  a gem of a person! She immediately made me feel at ease with her bedside manner and her kind words. I was nervous but she made me laugh, and I felt totally comfortable with her.  She explained the surgery in great detail, and she is an artist! She drew amazing sketches to show me what her surgery plan was and that in itself gave me a lot of confidence in her skills. My surgery went smoothly, with a great staff and anesthesiologist. I decided to do my upper and lower eyelids at the same time. My recovery went well and I didn't even have much swelling or bruising.

She was caring and talented and I highly recommend her to anyone contemplating eyelid surgery.",POS
2436,928881,"I am a 30 year old lawyer who debated plastic surgery for many, many years before deciding to do it-- and I do not have words to convey how grateful I am for making that decision and for finding Dr. Devgan.



I have a small frame and I always felt my thighs and arms were disproportionate.  I was tired of feeling insecure about them, even when I dieted properly and exercised regularly, and finally decided to do plastic surgery.



I'm a lawyer so of course I had a TON of questions.  Dr. Devgan was incredibly patient about answering all my questions, and from the first time I spoke with her on the phone, I knew I was in good hands.  She is incredibly knowledgeable, clearly passionate about what she does, and her empathy and compassion towards patients instantly made me feel comfortable.  I also kept losing some of my notes and I was amazed by how available (and again, patient she was).  For example, I definitely asked a million times about when I could get back to exercise, what type of exercise, what type of compression garments, how long I had to wear them, etc etc.  I contacted her directly via phone and email and she always got back to me within minutes (even when I texted her at midnight).  Post-surgery, I was also so touched by how available and clearly caring she was.  She called to check up on me regularly and was always available to answer my questions.  Also, once I decided to get the surgery, I wanted to get it right then and there.  Plus, I had figured I could take advantage of having days off from work for the holidays.  She was able to fit me in over the holidays, and she even was willing to come in for my post-op check-up on Christmas!! because I was flying overseas the next day.  To say she goes above and beyond for her patients is selling her short.



But what you're probably most concerned with is the results.  I will say that she was definitely more expensive than other surgeons I had considered but it was definitely clear why.  I'm now two months after my surgery and the results are huge.  I'm able to fit into clothes I haven't been able to wear in years (because of saddlebags, etc.) and it has really just made a world of difference.  I know she is incredibly technically proficient, both in how she explained things to me after, and in seeing the results after (perfectly symmetrical changes, exactly the amount of difference she had predicted).  Also, I was pleasantly surprised by how quick my recovery time was.  Part of the reason I had put off surgery is because I had friends who couldn't work out for months, had extensive bruising for nearly a month, etc. and I just couldn't afford that much down time.  I was so surprised by how easy my recovery was (which goes back to the careful technique she uses in doing the surgery).  I was WALKING around the evening of my surgery, going for an hour walk two days later, and I was back in the gym two weeks later.  I know that one concern I had prior to the surgery was that I was a bridesmaid for a wedding two weeks after the surgery and my dress showed my arms (where I had also had plastic surgery).  I had bought a backup bridesmaid dress that covered my arms, knowing I probably would not be able to show them, but I was pleasantly surprised that though there was still bruising, they had faded away enough that I could wear my original dress.

I have tried 3 other obs before and found him to be the most compatent. he handeled my situation very well since i had a previous c section before and a post partum hemorrhage. i highly recomend him. his personality is short but to the point. and his knowledge in obstetrics sure is a cut above the rest. he came to delivery on time and made sure i was comfortable and that i had everything i needed.,POS

(I've been in his office when he's taken calls regarding issues that tell me he's regarded as an expert.) Yes, the waits can be long, but I look at it this way: if it were me who had questions, was pregnant, etc., I'd take up some of his time, too! As a woman, you can't honestly expect all of your ob/gyn appointments to run exactly as scheduled. It took me such a long time to find a great dr (a friend recommended him.)

I am not sure where people get the impression that he is rushed - he takes time to discuss all of my questions - but then again, I come prepared with a ton of them.  Unless he is in surgery, I can ALWAYS get him on the phone to answer a question.  He is the most accessible doctor I have ever seen.  It's true that you used to have to wait for a while before being seen, but the office procedures have greatly improved and the average wait time now is about 10 minutes.

At my first visit with Mucciolo (at about 20 weeks), I told him about the chicken pox and he yeah yeah-ed me. He obviously wasn't really listening because at my next visit (24 weeks), I mentioned the chicken pox again (I was a nervous wreck about it) and he said, ""you had CHICKEN POX? Has anyone talked to you about an ABORTION?"" I'm 6 months pregnant, I said. You could go to somewhere out of the country to have it, he said. I left the office in tears.

If you are someone that wants handholding and a lot of time with your doctor then Dr. Mucciolo is not the Doctor for you.

Mucciolo's office then lost the test results. The Dr. and his asst. asked me to which lab they sent the test results. After losing the results, no one apologized. The Dr. said ""you don't have cancer"" and then said that I shouldn't worry. That it was no big deal. And that i could just wait a few months and get the test again.

He might not seem serious enough. But he tries to relax you and make you feel like its not that big of a deal that you have this or that...he gives you hope, meds, and he's just plain quality stuff.

I am now 4 months post-op and completely satisfied with the surgery results performed by Dr. Devgan.  For the majority of my adult life, this excessive labia and perineum tissue interfered with comfortable intercourse, wearing fitted pants and daily hygiene.  I always felt like I had a deformity and have experienced many embarrassing moments when the perineum tissue slipped out of my underwear or bathing suit in addition to my large labia giving me the camel foot in all tight pants causing me to go up a size just for comfort.  This surgery has changed my life drastically !!! I now feel at ease and enjoy having intimate relations, I walk freer in clothing that actually fits correctly and the cleaning ritual after using the restroom has ended.
Dr. Devgan is an extremely knowledgeable, compassionate and skilled surgeon on this procedure as she took the time to explain all the necessary guidelines on pre-op requirements, sedation options and what to expect post-op at various stages of the healing process.  Any questions or post-op issues I had, Dr. Devgan herself was available to me, I was never referred to her staff - although they too were outstanding before, during and after!

When I met Dr. Devgan it was clear to me that she was a whole lot more than I expected.  During my consultation she thoroughly explained everything about the procedure, she took her time, she didn't rush me and actually put me at ease.  I explained that I was looking for a natural and discreet look and she was confident that she could give me the look I was trying to achieve.  Well, she exceeded my expectations!

Not only would I recommend Dr. Devgan 150% to anyone but I also want to thank her",POS
2940,928881,"I have had the pleasure of working alongside Dr. Devgan for several years as a Nurse, and recently I was interested in Botox and Micro needling. I have dealt with Acne scars and just a ""tired exhausted look"" for a while, and I really desired some ""sprucing up"". 
When i walked into her office on the UES I was pleasantly greeted by a welcoming reception staff and what is probably the best array of magazines in her waiting room. The ambience is relaxing and clean and soothing. The office aesthetically is beautiful and modern. Each procedure and consult room is pristine and as a nurse I notice cleanliness first; and that is imperative when choosing a physician and surgeon. 
We had my consult and she made some reccomendations and we went with a treatment of microneedling and then botox to be followed the next week. I had the microneedling and she applied lidocaine cream onto my face so that I would be comfortable (which I was), and then proceeded with the treatment. Microneedling is basically a nano-sized group of needles that through strategic passing over your face stimulates new collagen production and a glowing radiant complexion. And believe you me--- I was GLOWING. Its parallel to about 6 months of facials at one time. So when you see the cost of this procedure, just remind yourself that you're getting 6+ months of facials at once. I haven't really worn any foundation or base makeup since the procedure- and that is because I have radiant glowing skin. I was red for a few hours afterward but was completely comfortable the entire time. I am going to go back for another session in a few months. 
As for the botox- well- simply stated, she uses a method of small injections systematically placed to give a natural look ""baby botox"", so there is no ""frozen face"" result.
 
I have recommended Dr. Devgan to all of my colleagues and girlfriends and honestly- she is the utmost professional, knowledgeable, skilled, personable, kind, and honest provider. I respect her opinion and with the years of research and training under her belt, I know that I am receiving forward- thinking best practice.
 As for my results- well- I could not be happier. I have taken thousands of amazing selfies with my now more refreshed and well rested face, as opposed to the previously exhausted look I was accustomed to.

Thank you Dr. LD!",POS

I was extremely nervous about my surgery, but she took her time during the consultation to explain every aspect of it to me. After explaining to her my needs and wants, she worked out a surgical plan that would accommodate me. And her kindness and attentiveness didn't stop at the surgery. Post-surgery, she was available at all times, whether it be by email, cell-phone, or person, to answer all my questions, anxieties and fears about recovery. 

Now, this attribute is definitely what made me choose her to be my surgeon, but I had initially found her based on her credentials. At the end of the day, it is the results that matter, and Dr. Devgan will give you amazing results. She is well-trained and very skilled at what she does. I cannot even begin to praise her surgical technique. I am in awe at the results she gave me. Whether it be minimal scarring, symmetrical incisions, or naturally beautiful results, she managed to do this all and give me optimal results that surpassed my expectations. 

Having lost a lot of weight, I never thought I would ever look this way. I especially did not expect my breasts to look this amazing without augmentation (and was even told this by other surgeons). Yet somehow Dr. Devgan managed to do it impeccably through only a breast lift and with a quick recovery!

She showed me a video, but the video was all about being bi-polar. So it was sort of a way to see where in the bi-polar scale do I fit as opposed to really trying to diagnose me. I thought it was weird, very strange. Then she wanted to prescribe me sleeping pills, I said no and just asked her for what I knew worked for my anxiety which was propranolol.

Dr.Pearlman changed all of that, now when I look in the mirror I smile. My first step towards looking more youthful was Ultherapy.

The Botox and Fillers were a little uncomfortable, I had some minor bruising and swelling but it only lasted a few days but the results are amazing! A few weeks later I went back to see Dr Pearlman's Beauty expert, Donna Fay for skincare. Donna Fay was very informative and explained everything to me before using the micropen on my face and neck. She recommended products for me to use that would help my skin heal and stay moisturized after my treatment, as well as products to start a week later to maintain the  beautiful results. After about 5 days my skin felt silky and I was glowing, people actually commented on how refreshed I looked. Donna Fay followed up with me to ensure I was following her directions and that I understood how to use my products which was nice.

She was patient, kind, assuring. and really acknowledged my concerns and desires, helping me choose the perfect size for my frame.  I honestly could not be ANY happier with the results.

Throughout the surgery process, she was kind and understanding. She explained things every step of the way. Her office and staff were lovely, and my facelift has taken off 10 years from my appearance. I used to look tired, with heavy eyelids and sagging skin under my jawline.

Despite the extremely short appointments, she doesn't listen to a word you say during that time. I've been taking Adderall and told her that the effects may be wearing off, since I've been tired all the time. At the end of our 90 seconds, she proceeded to ask if I needed a refill for Sonata (a sleep aid). She constantly pushes all these 'mood stabilizers' though I clearly have no mood issues (until I actually took her up on it, and felt worse than ever before).

She will not talk to you about personal problems or show any interest in you as an individual. I think she just sees a patient as a big brain full of chemistry that needs some drugs. I have been prescribed Depakote, Prozac, Wellbutrin, Gabitril, Lunesta, Sonata and now Animi-3 which is an expensive combination of omega-3 and B vitamins.Co-pay for this is $30.

She seemed very cold and by the time I wound up in the hospital I was in really bad shape. I went to her for treatment because my internist knew her.

After being in the hospital for suicide and coming in to her office for my next visit she asked me how my summer was! Not that well considering I was in the hospital last weekend!! My point is that she sees so many patients she doesn't have time for personalized treatment. When she tried to put me on the 4th medication I questioned her and she became very snotty with me and told me it wasn't her fault I was on so many meds, it was mine.

She asked the same panned questions on every 15 min visit..(how do you feel today on a scale of 1 to 10), which I think are too general and non-specific to make a real diagnosis. Also diagnosed me as bi-polar and having a mood disorder. I've seen many mental health doctors and never before or since have been diagnosed as bipolar. She put me on Paxil and when I was tired and still depressed put me on Lamictal as an ""upper"" even thought it's used for bi-polar patients. I wish she'd had the time to find a drug other than Paxil that worked better for me, instead of putting me on a 2nd unnecessary drug. Not the worst doc I've seen, but not great.

She was extremely understanding and knowledgeable about feet. She injected a medication for my toe pain that no other doctor ever tried or suggested before, and it totally worked.

It is an injection that I have never heard of before (I had read that she is known for this, and it is often used by dancers and models who are on their feet a lot). It WORKED!

3456,920796,"While the first doctor to warrant the appellation ""psychologist"" might have been a coolly analytical Austrian doctor, the practice of therapy itself is as old as the first time one human being listened with empathy to another. Jeffrey Kottler has an excellent discussion of this in his wonderful book On Being a Therapist. The west, he elegantly reminds us, does not have a monopoly on therapeutic healing; it has gone on successfully under different guises in all cultures, from time immemorial.

What our culture brings to the table, characteristically, is dispassionate ""objectivity"" in a capitalist environment. For 45 minutes and an exorbitant price, we'll submerge you in the latest and greatest technique backed by the latest and greatest stats and studies. You'll receive nuanced legal protections and your treatment procedure will have all the trappings of professionalism that we've come to expect from corporate capitalism.

Shiphra is different. You'll still be afforded the same nuanced legal protections, but you'll also receive something intangible that we all instinctively know is evaporating from our culture: caring. At first it felt weird to me - what is this thing I felt directed at me? Just give me my prognosis and meds and let me be on my way, I'd think. Or I'd wonder if I wasn't imagining it. After all, I'd had experience with numerous therapists over a decade of suffering with ""depression and anxiety"", and I'd never felt anything like this before. I never went over the time so routinely, I was never allowed to be lost in my musings so regularly. I never had a therapist get frustrated with me, but I needed that, and Shiphra gave me that. I never had a therapist laugh with such abandon at something I'd said, but I needed that too. She has a wonderful, reverberant laugh.

Laughter is, sadly, another one of those few deeply human intangibles we're losing to commodification. Nowadays just about everything is for sale in one way or another: love as sex, esteem as flattery to a professional or social superior. Shiphra touches a part of us that predates hierarchies, commodification, and dispassionate objectivity. She reminds us that people can connect with each other, in spite of the different ornaments of status we carry around. She may not have a wall full of diplomas, but she has a soul full of intelligent love. Problems or no problems, do yourself a favor and dig out that withering part of yourself that hides under all the required daily bluster and bravado. Bring it to your first appointment and watch with pride as it slowly remembers how to live and bloom.",NEU

After waiting for an hour, was brought back for x-rays with a male hygienist/x-ray tech. He was asking me a lot about my profession, setting up the x-rays, putting the vest on me etc. when he asked if I had a boyfriend. 

Startled, I replied yes, at which point he grabbed my hand and said, ""You're just so fucking sexy.""

Panic/confusion took over and I mumbled something inaudible and got my hand back. 

He started repeating, ""You know you are."" He grabbed my hand a couple more times, asked how old I was, and REMINDED ME HE COULD LOOK AT MY FILE FOR ANY INFORMATION he needed.

Needless to say, I didn't stay for the cleaning with Dr. Kirsch.

I called the office the same day, though, and spoke with a receptionist. I explained what had happened and was given a brief, vague, and frankly bored sounding apology ""that my experience wasn't good.""


The office manager, Angela, did call me back later that afternoon. She got me on the phone to speak with Dr. Kirsch who sounded HUGELY disingenuous/perplexed when talking to me about the incident. 

He didn't even seem to know why I was calling until I heard the manager speaking to him hurriedly in the background. In fact, he began the conversation, ""So... I guess you were unhappy about something in the office?"" They got briefly more emphatic about how sorry they were when it sounded as though I was going to alert the authorities. But, just barely.

You will be impressed by your first visit. They'll set you up with your initial consultation very quickly. They will be very nice to you, but it won't seem genuine. It isn't. 

You'll be escorted throughout the office to have an ultrasound, blood work, meet with the doctor, who will recommend mini-IVF and PGD. It feels rushed. But you are wiling to do whatever it takes. You are sure you've finally found the right place!  An answer to your prayers. You will talk to the billing department. You will cringe at the cost of this supposed more affordable treatment option, but you will mentally justify the cost.

You will be sent home with some information but lots of questions. They will assure you of their ability & willingness to answer any of your questions & concerns. You will be comforted by that.

You will go home. You will have a question or two or three, now that you've had time to digest the limited information they gave you. If you were treated anywhere else before now,you will be disappointed at the lack of info in comparison to your last RE. 

You will call New Hope and get to a voicemail box for the nurses. You will leave a message. The nurses will not return your call. You will send an email. The nurses will not reply to your email. You will have a billing question and leave a voicemail for the billing department. No one will call you back. You will email the billing department. Your email will be ignored. You will call and email again. You will wait DAYS AND DAYS for a response from ANYONE in this entire practice, and that response will NEVER come!! You will call again and again and leave message after message. You will start making your email subject lines more urgent & you will be downright enraged that you are BEING IGNORED by the very people who led you to believe you were in good hands. 

You will wonder how you will be treated when you are actually fully under their care & have clinical questions or concerns. More time will pass. You will not hear from them.  You will go online & you will post a scathing review of this incompetent group and you will warn others not to waste their precious time here!!

There is no care, concern for the patient.   This is a stressful, emotional process and the had fuel to the fire.

3648,2002885,"I came here in Dec 2014 after failed conventional cycles at two large university based clinics in NYC. I was hesitant to come to New Hope given the mixed reviews here and elsewhere. However, I came anyway because the other cycles were similar to one another both in terms of protocol and poor results. New Hope's mini IVF protocol was different. Plus, a cycle is much cheaper because the expectation is you will cycle more times to get sufficient embryos. This was a cheap(er) way to test my eggs to see if they could fertilize and whether lower stims would help me. I am so glad I came. 

If you have been to a big clinic, you will be used to the drill at NH - waiting room full of women for morning monitoring, daily updates from the nurses (your primary contact). New Hope's blood tests are more comprehensive, testing a number of hormone levels each day, and nurses email patients with the results and protocol. The longer monitoring hours (7am-2pm) are a huge convenience, especially for folks who work in midtown. 

I didn't experience any of the snafus that other women have experienced. Perhaps they are running the clinic more efficiently these days. Make no mistake though, this is a busy place. Like at other large centers, you will interact primarily with the nurses and there are wait times for monitoring. I've had to wait. 

I never thought I would be doing this 4 times in my mid 30s. If you have gone the conventional route with lackluster results (in my case: ~5 mature eggs at retrieval, low fertilization), it might be worth considering a different protocol. I experienced better results here than on the conventional protocols. Dr. Zhang changed many things about my protocol, and these changes improved my results tremendously. I'm not at the end of the journey yet, but New Hope has given me just that, new hope.",POS
3649,2002885,"I went to New Hope for 5 years; at first I really liked them since they allowed me to do egg retrievals without drugs. I did 28 cycles all-together, but only got 8 embryos, there were many missed cycles do to ovulation, and many ""Discard"". But I always held out hope that eventually one would take, no luck (granted I was 44 when I started with NH). 

The issue that made me feel the need to write this post was the continual mishaps that occurred with my gestational surrogate:

. Once I flew her and her husband to NY, I request a blood test of my GS prior to transfer only to find that they had to cancel the cycle; had they tested her prior to coming to NY I would not have had to pay for two plane flights here and back to Colorado. 

. The clincher was when I moved to donor egg, the plan was to sync my GS with the egg donor to do a fresh transfer, well the clinic forgot to tell my GS to stop her birth control so we lost the one time opportunity to do a fresh transfer. 

. When we did the frozen transfer the doctor who did the transfer told my GS that her hormone level was only a 12.5 (not optimal for two hatched blasts) and said she should be on injectable progesterone, not just suppositories; by the time my GS started the injections it was late in the game, needless to say no luck. 

. The disappointing part was we wanted to talk with the doctor after the transfer, we laterally waited around 7 times to have a conference call and each time we were stood up. When I finally met with Dr.Chang I was told I ""slipped through the cracks"".

The big problem was that after the surgery I could barely breathe out of one side. Instead of carefully evaluating where the exact problem was, Dr. Aston proceeded to completely remove the inferior turbinate on that side. According to my ENT, this was poor judgment and likely aggravated matters, including the eventual complete loss of sense of smell years later. The disruption in normal air flow caused by the radical resection of the turbinate was likely the cause of the chronic infections I always had since then.

I repect her medical opinions  and feel her tests are orderd correctly.   Her staff I love more than her. She can be cranky at times, but the staff is always sweet and thoughtful.
